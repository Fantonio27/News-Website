				<p class="p5">MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine National Police (PNP) on Wednesday launched its “Ligtas Sumvac (Summer Vacation) 2022” campaign aimed at ensuring the safety of motorists and travelers during the summer months and the upcoming long holiday.<br><br>

				The PNP said it is anticipating a larger crowd this year since many tourism sites have reopened after a two-year hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic-induced restrictions.<br><br>

				“We are alerting all police units and stations to strictly adhere to our guidelines so we can avoid the resurgence of Covid cases and deter crimes from happening,” PNP Chief Police General Dionardo Carlos said in a statement.<br><br>

				In launching this initiative, the PNP said it has released a set of operational guidelines to better ensure that minimum public health standards and peace and order are maintained especially in tourist destinations or places of worship.
				<br><br>
				Under the guidelines, police units and stations are tasked to coordinate with community-based volunteers and force multipliers to be deployed whenever there is a significant activity.
				<br><br>
				Police authorities must also work with the Department of Tourism or their local counterparts to produce and distribute safety tips that can serve as guides for tourists.
				<br><br>
				Regular inspection of tourist sites is likewise a must, alongside the conduct of mobile patrols and implementation of maximum police visibility in places of convergence and vital installations such as the passenger terminals, the PNP said.</p>
				<br><hr><br></br><p class="p5">
				Each police station assigned in the LGUs must also activate their tourist police to focus on specific complaints so immediate action can be taken, it added.
				<br><br>
				“We remind our establishments and other tourist-related businesses to continue practicing the health protocol and to have their system of guest monitoring. If prohibitions like the curfew and liquor ban are still in effect in areas where they belong, then they are obliged to adhere,” Carlos said.
				<br><br>
				The safety of everyone, despite the easing of protocol, can only be attained if there is a concerted effort among stakeholders, he added.
				<br><br>
				Metro Manila and 47 other areas in the country will be under COVID-19 Alert Level 1 from March 16 to March 31.
				<br><br>
				Under Alert Level 1, all establishments, persons, or activities are allowed to operate, work, or be undertaken at full on-site capacity, provided that minimum public health protocols are strictly observed.
				<br><br>
				Intrazonal and interzonal shall also be allowed without regard to age and comorbidities.<br><br><br><br></p>
