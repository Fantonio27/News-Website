				<p class="p5">Messages of sadness and gratitude flowed out when it was announced in November of 2020 that the College of Holy Spirit Manila (CHSM) was closing its doors. “Thank you for being the foundation on which we have built not only our careers but also the values that we have carried on in our lives,” wrote one of its graduates on Facebook then. <br><br>

				As April approaches, pulling the school’s last days closer, photos of the empty campus continue to circulate on social media, inspiring feelings of nostalgia especially among those who once walked the CHS halls. Former students remember it for the high academic standards it maintained and the values it instilled in them. Back in 2020, however, one of the standout recollections was about how it was the cleanest campus in Mendiola, thanks to a dedicated group of Ilocano women who made sure the school grounds were always a sight to behold. <br><br>

				<p class="p5">
				The CHS was originally Holy Ghost College, a primary school established along Legarda Street in Manila in 1913 by the Missionary Sisters Servant of the Holy Spirit (SSpS). It started offering secondary education in 1920 and also opened another site in nearby Mendiola St. It was in 1965 when the school was rechristened College of the Holy Spirit. Among the women who studied in the campus are Josie Natori, the journalist Sheila Coronel, lawyer and beauty queen Pacita Ongsiako de los Reyes, Ayala Foundation president Vicky Garchitorena, University of the Philippines’ VP for Academic Affairs Dr. Cynthia Banzon, Elvira Manahan, Imelda Cojuangco, Mary Walter and economics professor Rosario Roxas Moran, the mother of Margie Moran Floirendo. <br><br>

				Over the past year, former students have been visiting the school to say their final goodbyes. More campus tours have been scheduled in the coming days due to clamor from various alumni aching to have one last look at the institution that helped mold them to the women they’ve become. <br><br></p>

				<p class="p5">Some of them have been gathered here along with their priceless recollections, thanks to the kindness of Lorraine Young-Sylianteng, a high school alum from 1973–who helped us send our questions and await the answers. May their words help bring to life the images we’ve gathered.<br><br><br><br>
