				Citing global data as of March 18, OCTA Research said confirmed COVID-19 cases decreased by 22 percent to an average 527 daily during that week compared to the previous week.<br><br>

				The computed average daily attack rate of 0.47 indicated less than one new COVID-19 case detected daily per 100,000 population during the past week.<br><br>

				OCTA Research said 24 more COVID-19 deaths were recorded by the Department of Health (DOH), pushing the death toll to 58,023 out of 3,673,717 confirmed coronavirus cases.<br><br></p>

				<p class="p5">On March 15, the DOH said all areas in the country were now at low risk for COVID-19.<br><br>

				As of March 18, Timor-Leste, Myanmar, Taiwan, Cambodia and Indonesia are also at very low risk based on the same metrics, OCTA said.<br><br>
