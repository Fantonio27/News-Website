				<p class="p5">MANILA, Philippines â€” Consumers are finally getting some relief after 11 weeks of uninterrupted fuel price increases that started in January this year.<br><br>

				Oil companies on Monday announced a big rollback in the prices of petroleum products starting midnight Tuesday: P11.45 for a liter of diesel, P5.45 for gasoline, and P8.55 for kerosene, which many households still use for cooking and heating.<br><br>

				This is the first reduction in local pump prices since December last year when oil companies lowered their prices by P2 to P3 a liter.<br><br>

				While this may be the first double-digit rollback in fuel prices, the cuts still failed to offset the cumulative net increases in prices this year.<br><br></p>
				<hr><br><br>
				<p class="p5">Prior to the rollback, diesel has gone up by P30.65, gasoline by P20.35, and kerosene by P24.90. Last week, oil companies implemented the biggest ever increase in local pump prices of between P7 and P13 a liter.<br><br>

				The latest reduction was due to the decline in global oil prices last week, although increasing tension between Russia and Ukraine could easily reverse the downtrend.<br><br>

				The International Energy Agency also noted that the decline in crude prices might be temporary and warned of a supply shortage if Russian oil would be cut from the rest of the world as part of sanctions being considered by Western countries.<br><br></p>
