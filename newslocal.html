                                Akbayan party-list on Monday urged the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to release the decisions on the pending cases against Ferdinand 
                                “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s presidential bid which are currently pending before the commission en banc. advertisement In a letter dated March 21,
                                 representatives of Akbayan emphasized that the Comelec’s decision is not just about the candidate but will determine the future of the nation. 
                                 “The election is 49 days away, yet Marcos Jr’s sham presidential run has been allowed to continue this far. If this is not resolved before the election, 
                                 this could rob many Filipinos of the ability to choose from a genuinely qualified list of candidates, and completely contaminate and debase their votes,” 
                                 the Akbayan letter read. They argued that allowing the public to vote for a “fake, unqualified" candidate betrays the trust and the spirit of the vote itself. 
                                 “We see no reason for the Comelec to further delay the resolution of this case, especially that the membership of its en banc is now complete. 
                                 Any further delay is already a gross disservice to the voting public and our electoral system and favors Marcos Jr.’s grand fakery,” they emphasized.

                                       Akbayan is one of the petitioners that filed a disqualification case against Marcos, 
                                       citing the presidential candidate’s tax convictions in 1995. This, however, was dismissed by the former Comelec 
                                       First Division for “lack of merit.” A motion for reconsideration was already filed before the Comelec en banc. 
                                       Akbayan insisted that Marcos should be disqualified from running for the country’s highest post, asserting that the late dictator’s son was 
                                       convicted of tax evasion while he served as Ilocos Norte governor and the penalties for his crime include disqualification from holding public office. 
                                       “Akbayan affirms its conviction: Marcos should be disqualified from running for the Presidency. Our case rests on the solid fact that Bongbong Marcos was 
                                       convicted of tax evasion while he served as Governor of Ilocos. The penalties for his crime clearly state that he should be disqualified from holding public office. 
                                       This alone is reason enough for the Comelec to disqualify Marcos Jr.,” the group said. However, what makes Marcos Jr.’s disqualification “more urgent and compelling” was the Bureau of Internal Revenue’s 
                                       confirmation that he has P203 billion unsettled tax liabilities, Akbayan added. “It clearly shows a track record of tax evasion and a character flaw of willful disrespect for the law and the welfare of the Filipino people. This is what our petition has been consistently saying all along. 
                                       It is impossible for the Comelec not to see that Marcos Jr. and his family are notorious tax evaders,” Akbayan said. “The Comelec has no other recourse but to disqualify Bongbong Marcos. Its decision will go a long way in ensuring that the public not only chooses wisely, but that it does so based on the rule of law and the integrity of our electoral democracy. 
                                       Any worthwhile vision for our people should rest only on the foundation of fact and truth. 
                                       Your decision should justify our faith in these values,” they added. GMA News Online has reached out to Marcos’ camp for comment, but they have yet to respond as of posting time.
