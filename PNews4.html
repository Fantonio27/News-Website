				<p class="p5">Former Senator Ferdinand "Bongbong" Marcos Jr. said Saturday that other presidential candidates have insufficiently  thought through their plans for the economy, and pandemic response.<br><br>

				"Noong nakita ko ‘yung mga ibang tatakbo, sabi ko [habang] nakikinig sa kanila, hindi yata napag-isipan ng mabuti ‘yung kanilang sinasabi na plataporma o plano para sa COVID-19 at ekonomiya," he said in an interview with Erwin Tulfo, and Presidential Communications Secretary Martin Andanar.<br><br>

				(I listened to the plans of other presidential candidates regarding the economy and the fight against COVID-19, and I suspect these were not well-thought-out.)<<br><br></p>
				<hr><br><br>
				<p class="p5"><b>Decision to run</b><br><br>

				"Syempre tinitingnan ko ‘yung political situation. Ano ba talagang mangyayari dito, pumanig lahat sa opposition," he said.<br><br>

				"Ako nakapanig naman sa administrasyon. Sabi ko, siguro kung ako ‘yung nandoon, siguro kaya ko na ipaglaban ito at somepoint sabi ko sige, I’ll run for presidency," he added.<br><br>

				Asked if he will take inspiration from his father's Masagana 99 program, Marcos Jr. said, "Yes. Hindi natin nakalimutan yun, hindi lang natin ginagamit."<br><br></p>

				<p class="p5"><b>Spreading fake news</b><br><br>

				Bongbong belies claims that his camp is spreading misinformation or fake news.<br><br>

				During a town hall meeting in Marikina on Saturday, he was asked how he can be trusted amid the continued spread of disinformation.<br><br>

				“Ang pinakamaganda para maiwasan ‘yung mga lumalabas na hindi tama, kailangan kami din. Hindi kami gumagawa ng fake news. Para alam ng tao, lahat ng sasabihin naming ay totoo,” he said.<br><br>

				He added: "Unang-una wala kayong naririnig na fake news sa akin, ang daming sinisisi sa akin na pinapalitan daw namin ang kasaysayan ng Pilipinas.” <br><br>

				To fight the dissemination of fake news, the former Senator said he will improve his credibility and help the public to research more about history.<br><br></p>

				<p class="p5"><b>Dignified silence</b><br><br>

				Marcos Jr. on Sunday urged Filipinos to respect each other’s freedom to choose the candidate they will support in the upcoming elections.<br><br>

				Marcos’ appeal came after the noticeable increase in “vitriolic exchanges” among supporters of competing candidates on various social media platforms.<br><br>

				“There is no reason for us to fight with one another over whom to support in the coming elections.  Let's respect each other's freedom to choose.  My response to hateful speech has always been to maintain a dignified silence because bickering is a waste of time,” he said.<br><br>

				“Now more than ever, we should not lose sight of our goal of uniting the country and helping our people free themselves from the grip of poverty that has weakened his belief in himself," he added.<br><br><br><br></p>
